A dynamic, hands-on, detail-oriented, and highly analytical senior software engineer working on web applications and web infrastructure. I have been developing professionally for over 7 years but tinkering since a kid.

I can help everywhere in the stack and I love wearing multiple hats to an extent. Although, I do think my strongest skills are in software engineering.

Most of my positions utilized agile-like development processes using JIRA. I am also PSM I certified from scrum.org.

A day in my life may consist of adding an API endpoint, enhancing front-end features, dockerizing an application, database design, setting up a build or deployment plan.
